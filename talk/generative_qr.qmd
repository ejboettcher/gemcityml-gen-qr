## What is Generative AI 

Generative AI generates new content based on an input(s). Inputs and outputs to these models can include text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models, or other types of data.  
  
  
<br>  

### How Does Generative AI Work?
Generative AI models use neural networks to identify the patterns and structures within existing data to generate new and original content.

## What is a QR (Quick Response) Code


:::{.columns}

Invented in 1994, by Japanese company Denso Wave for labelling automobile parts.  
<br>

A QR code (quick-response code) is a type of two-dimensional matrix barcode.  
<br>

A QR code consists of **black squares** arranged in a square grid on a **white background**, with fiducial markers.  
<br>  


It is read by a camera, and processed using Reed–Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. (wikipedia)  
<br>  


You can store any text in a QR Code.

## Binary Encoder

## What is a bit/byte and Binary?

* Bit: 0 or 1: Black or White
* Byte: 8 Bits

### Binary: 

* 00000001 = 1
* 00000010 = 2
* 00000100 = 4
* 00010100 = 36
* 11111111 = 255  aka $2^8-1$


## Importance of Black and White

* Thresholding
* Colors 

* Filled or partical filled squares.  Which is why the below all work.

### Gen AI QR is not

* QR with cut out and art pasted in
  * With High reliable QR setting you can replace up to 35% of the image.

## Gen AI QR: GemCity.TECH
Gen AI QR takes advantage of the fact that you do not need full squares and colors (for plain qr) is not used.
