## What is Generative AI 

Generative AI generates new content based on an input(s). Inputs and outputs to these models can include text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models, or other types of data.

### How Does Generative AI Work?
Generative AI models use neural networks to identify the patterns and structures within existing data to generate new and original content.

A QR code (quick-response code) is a type of two-dimensional matrix barcode.  
<br>

A QR code consists of **black squares** arranged in a square grid on a **white background**, with fiducial markers.  
<br>  


It is read by a camera, and processed using Reedâ€“Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. (wikipedia)  
<br>  


You can store any text in a QR Code.

## What is a bit/byte and Binary?

* Bit: 0 or 1: Black or White
* Byte: 8 Bits

### Binary: 

* 00000001 = 1
* 00000010 = 2
* 00000100 = 4
* 00010100 = 36
* 11111111 = 255  aka $2^8-1$


## Importance of Black and White

* Thresholding
* Colors 

* Filled or partical filled squares.  Which is why the below all work.
